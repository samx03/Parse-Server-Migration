# parse-server migration

This demo project contains a parse-server backend to migrate from a hosted server on Moralis to a self-hosted server, using parse-server.

## Getting started locally

1. Copy/download this project
2. Make sure to have `yarn` or `npm` insalled
3. Setup mongo-db and redis locally (see below)
5. Install all dependencies via `yarn install` or `npm install` 
6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values

### Run your dapp

- Run `yarn dev` to run the server locally

Now your app is running locally on `localhost:1337/server` (or any other port/endpoint you set in `.env`)
